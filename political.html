<p>Having a government that was a bureaucracy and a representative democracy caused many civilizations to have more control and more useful and thought out opinions on the laws. In Ancient China during Han dynasty, they had a central bureaucracy with the emperor having the power but had educated government officials around him. The emperor is chosen by bloodline but they will start preparing to be emperors their whole lives. All the officials had to pass test on a common philosophy which caused the people to be on the same page which was less chaotic since they have almost the same mindsets when making decisions. We have a university where they would learn to become the government officials like. Also, in Ancient Rome they had a representative democracy where only certain people were able to vote for the cities laws. The people were educated which gave more thought out votes since they know about the city's past. Because they were both were a successful types of government, our civilization is a bureaucratic representative democracy where there will be meetings with the emperor and one representative of each group either religion or the head of the military where they all have one say or vote when they are making laws. This would be held in the government building also where the emperor lives since he is the head of the government. It has a hollow dome shaped roof made out of concrete since we wanted to make this building different from the rest. Laws are only past if the majority agrees. The representatives of each group are determined by the group's people. Which having educated representatives of each group in our societies able to vote, this caused people to hear many concerns and address them.
