<p>With a social contract between the people and the government this created order and stability in the city. In our civilization, people had to do 2 years mandatory military service, they had to do one year of service of free labor to help the city build monuments or buildings, 25% tax because of this the government give the people free of religion if they don't ask questions about other people's religion. Also, the government in return will give them protection, supply the people with food if natural disaster and let the people some say in the laws by a representative. Because of the social contract, the power went to the emperor then the government officials then the representatives of each group or religion and finally the people. Social contrasts are beneficial and when it first started with the hunters and gatherers where they made an agreement causing them to be safe but give them all of their freedom. However, if one party of the social contract breaks it, then the people are able to rebel or the government can do whatever the need to do the get the people in check. With a social contract, everybody knows what is expected of them which creates a more organized city.
