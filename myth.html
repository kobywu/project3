		<p class="page-description">Our myth had to relate to our territory and my myth had to be about a hero. Since we have a huge river full of fish, I decided to make a scenario where all the fish suddenly disappear. A man named Damian volunteers to go on a journey across the goblin filled mountains to talk to the gods to get the fish back.</p>

<p> There once was a city where feasts full of fish and vegetables were an annual event that kept the people united. Early one morning, where the dark sky has no trace of any white puff balls, fishermen would go to the clear blue river at the crack of dawn on hand-crafted wooden boats to go and collect the main dish for the feast in the water. They reached the river banks, get into the wooden canoes and sail off to catch their next meal. However, they have not been able to find any fishes or any edible creatures in more than an hour.
"It's empty! The fishes are all gone not even one has found a single little swimming animal in the entire river. The gods must be mad at us. But what have we done to make them feel this way? We never rebel or even fight! In what way will we thrive off of the nutritious vegetables and the dry grain without any meat to feed oneself? Someone needs to sacrifice themselves to go to the gods' palace and get them back!" the fisherman cries standing on rocking while flailing his lengthy arms around. 
Seeing that no one wants to go through the minotaur filled mountain, Damian, one of the strongest and intelligent man in the city, volunteers. People in hearing distance from Damian are jumping up and down cheering for him. The next morning, he sets off. A tan bag full of bread and fruit on his broad left shoulder with a sharp steel sword in the right hand. Walking through the roads, in the corner of his eyes, he sees little faces peeking from open windows to see him set off to get back the fish. 
One hundred miles later, he reaches the beginning of the path up the mountain. He takes a deep breath and slowly walks through on the snow covered trail. After seeing a strange man come into their homeland, creatures hide behind snow piles and the stems of the evergreen trees. Oblivious of the numerous gazes following his every single move, Damian walks carefully. He then hears rustling on his head and rapidly turns his head to search for the source. A huge minotaur with horns that seems as if its tips are sharper than Damian's sword comes up from behind and yells, "Who are you to come through my land?!". All the other creatures come out from hiding and surround the lone human. 
"I come in peace. I just want to pass by real quickly to get to the other side.", Damian said with his voice shaking.
"Fine. But there is only one way that I will let you pass. You will give us all your food and you have to solve this riddle in 3 guesses. If you do not achieve to answer this correctly then you shall die. Am I clear?"
"I am ready"
"What is alive without breathing, as cold as death, every traveling, never walking, mouth ever moving, mouth never talking. What am I?"
Damian's hands become sweaty while he thinks about the answer fearing for not only his life but for the rest of the city's. Suddenly, a lightbulb turns on in his head and confidently says, "A fish." The creatures' eyes look as if they will pop out of their shocked faces. They cannot believe even a demigod would be smart enough to figure that one out yet alone a human. Keeping his word, the minotaur lets him pass but warns him to never return or they will give him a trickier riddle. 
Damian's adrenaline from answering the riddle correctly makes him push the feelings of fatigue and hunger out of his mind. Looking forward, he sees a huge marble castle close by. He practically sprints over and pries open the heavy wooden door. The palace was like a dream. Gold, silver, marble covered the whole interior. He opens another set of marble doors and sees a round mahogany table surrounded by wealthy looking people. They wore silk and jewelry made from diamonds. They were the gods. The ones who took away their city's fish. Damian gets over his astonishment of knowing he is standing right in front of the gods and stomps his way to the table demanding to know why they took away the fish. 
"You humans are wasteful and take things for granted. We're not going to let you kill any more fish and not even eat it. If you humans agree to only catch fish when needs then you may have them back." the god of the sea states firmly.
"Okay! We will never take the fish or anything for granted. You know what, I will make sure that we don't even grab much fish anymore. Just give them back to us." Damian begs.
"Human. We provide you with fish and everything else so you may be prosperous. Of course, we want you to eat fish. Just beware that you want to make sure you keep your resources close and use them wisely or else they will become hard to find and control like a fish swimming quickly the opposite way." the gods say and with a snap of their fingers, the fish appear in the city's river.
