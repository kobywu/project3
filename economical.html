<p>With many citizens being farmers and traders in a society, this caused the society to catch up with the rest of the world in technologies and a surplus of food. A job that was very big in the Ancient times like the Chinese empires and the Islamic civilization were farmers. With many farmers and fertile land they were able to have a large surplus of food which gave them time to work on other projects to expand their societies. Since our territory has a big fertile farming area and a river full of sea life where we can travel and close to the ocean, and forests we have decided that about 2/3 of our people will be farmers. People have to have at least 10 acres and the max is 60 acres of land. We will be trading crops we farmed with territory 5, 6, 9 for iron to make weapons and horses where we could use their poop and put it in the plants as fertilizer to keep the soil from dying faster and to ride on when trading across the land. We also would trade wood from the forest with territory 2 to get goats also to use as fertilizer. In Ancient China and the Islamic civilization, international trading was a big thing this caused to not only get more money from selling goods but to get ideas and inventions and adapt to them which helps grow their economy. With this information, we have decided that in our civilization that many of our citizens will be merchants for us to get other materials and technologies. We have a marketplace where people sell different foods that we grow like pumpkins, tomatos, corn, wheat, apples and ect. Since our civilization's geography has benefits with fertile land and many ways to travel and trade, this caused our society to maintain a surplus and keep up with other civilizations technologies.
