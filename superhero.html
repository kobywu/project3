He got the powers to shooting ice, wind, water and fire and can do telekinesis. He has to help the governement with global warming by making ice sheets for the polar bears. Read my story down below.</p>

<p>It's 3 am on the isolated island of Kalei off the coast of Alaska is asleep. No light or noise is shown throughout the 500 square mile island. However, in the heart of the island in the Goodwin Estate's basement, a scientist named Mason Goodwin is working on a top secret experiment for the US Government- a drug to create superhumans. A group of five super humans each with different powers- fire,ice/ water, flight/ telekinesis.These super humans will fix the world's problems from stopping burning buildings to try to save animal's habitats.
Mason came from a wealthy family worth millions and millions of money from owning one of most successful clothing brands Goodwin. When Mason turned the big milestone of 21, his father wanted to pass the business down to his only heir, Mason. Even though Mason had the mindset of a businessman, he had no desire of talking in a stuffy meeting room every week with gray-haired men that wear too much cologne trying to compete with each other with their newest investments. With Mason's disinterest in the company, his parents value their image rather than their child's dream and disowned him. They arranged him to get all his things out of his room which took seven hours and leaves. Luckily they let him keep the 9.6 million dollars in his bank account which led Mason to buy his grayed three-storied Estate in the island of Kalei.
For eight years, Mason has been stuck in his lab alone trying to perfect these drugs. Test after test to get it just right. After the last test went just as planned, the government approved through a video chat after seeing Mason inject three small white mice with pink tails with 3 ml of the drug each and shooting fire/ice or can fly in their small glass case.
It's now time for the future superhumans to get into the steel chamber and become what they have been training for. Mason feels confident that it will work smoothly but feels as if butterflies are trying to get out of his stomach with all these government officials, military leaders and most importantly the President of the United States around him. All that's in his mind is "you cannot mess this up or your life is over." He treads slowly to the control room to the keyboard and presses all these buttons turning on the chamber. The first superhuman who will possess the power of ice/water waits for the syringe filled drug to pierce into her skin. A few moments later, the syringe won't move even an inch to the person. Mason's hands are shaking, nervous that it isn't going the way it's supposed to. He's pressing the button repeatedly getting very frustrated and checking the wires of the keyboard but doesn't see anything wrong with it.
General Sam Hobbs stomps into the control room and tells Mason impatiently, "What's going on?! Why isn't it working?!"
"I don't know General. I'm trying to fix it. It seems like it's the chamber, not the keyboard. I'm right on it. Give me 10 minutes max." Mason says scrabbling to get his tools and goes into the chamber. He sees that there is are loose screws by the syringes. He tightens all of them in the row. He's one step away from the door and it closed.
Mason starts pounding on the door getting all the people's attention. The see that he's stuck trying to stick both of his hand's fingertips in the crack of the door to open it. It wouldn't come apart. General Hobbs takes it into his own hands pressing all these buttons trying to figure out which one will open the door. Mason is freaking out not only because he is stuck in there but because no one but himself knows how to work the chamber or the keyboard. Then he is pushed to the center of the chamber with his feet and arms spread apart and locked. Mason then sees all the syringes coming his way on the left side. His mind is filled with regrets, "why did I take this job? Why did I trust someone to know how to work the keyboard? I am going to die. No human will ever survive getting one of my drugs in them yet alone all three." The three needles are pierced in his neck, letting all the liquids in him. The pain is unbearable feeling as if he is getting stabbed multiple times or his body parts are moving to different parts of his body. He then loses conscious.
Once the process was complete, the chamber doors open finally and the chamber's machine lets him free. People are rushing to Mason on the floor, putting 2 fingers on his neck trying to feel a pulse but knowing that he would have never survived. One because no human can ever survive three of the most powerful chemical enhancement drugs made and two because his body isn’t strong or fit enough to handle these drugs. Surprisingly General Hobbs feels a faint pulse. Then Mason shoots up, his eyes that were once brown were fully yellow.
Silence fills the room. General Hobbs helps Mason stand up and asks how he is doing."I feel fine. Why am I on the floor? Shouldn't I be in the control room? Did the superhumans work?" says Mason.
"Do you remember what happened Mason?" Agent Fuller says walking to him.
"All I remember is that I went to go fix the screws for the syringes since they would move. That's it. Why what did I miss?"
"You were trapped in the chamber and you got injected with the five syringes then you lost conscious."
"WHAT!?"Mason exclaims while pacing back and forth in front of everyone with his hands behind his head.
"We are all amazed you made it out alive. I thought only one human would be strong enough to possess one trait. I guess you just got lucky or something."
"I am so sorry Mr. President and everyone else. I didn't mean for this to happen"  Mason states looking worriedly at everyone.
"It seems like you have planned this. That you just wanted to use all of our money and us to help you make these drugs and then use them for yourself," the President says firmly still upset about this incident.
"No sir that was not my intentions. I swear."
"Well, there is a way for you to redeem yourself. Since we cannot wait for you to make another batch of the superpowers, you will be working for us. As our superhuman this time. If you were to decline then you will die. We cannot have someone so powerful not be on our side. So what do you think?"
"Anything. As long as I do not die. I am in."
Now on every day for eight hours Mason has a rigorous training practice to build up his muscles. During the first day of training, he regrets not making a drug for strength. Now he has to go through running two miles in the cold island's mountains and bench 400-pound weights. Plus he has to practice his powers every day as well. He first started learning something simple-flying outside of his Estate. In less than ten minutes, he can fly in figure eights and at least 30 miles per hour. Now he goes for something harder, controlling how much water/ice he wants to come out of his hands. He slowly got the hang of it and can make a three-foot snowman or a small one-foot ice castle out of ice. Now the hardest power to control, moving objects. Mason was feeling good from picking up all the other powers easily that he thought that moving objects with his mind was going to be a piece of cake. He focuses on moving a small brown rock one foot to the left but ends up throwing it about fifty feet away. Surprised that he couldn't do it, he keeps trying. Resulting in many items being throwing over the edge of the mountain. All the trainers are trying to help him but he wouldn't budge. "I don't need anyone's help. I can do this by myself." He thinks while starting getting annoyed that he cannot move a single rock without it being thrown somewhere out of sight. Done with today's practice, Mason walks away with his trainers yelling at him, "Get back here! You are not done." It takes Mason a lot of willpower to not use his powers on the yelling trainers.
He stays in his room for one week, not leaving even to get food. He just sits in front of his desk either looking at his right hand making a small bright red flame or making ice sculptures on his desk. Annoyed with his behavior, General Hobbs goes into Mason's room and sits in his desk chair and says, "Look you can't just give up just because you couldn't master a power on the first day. We are all surprised that you could even master one power. Don't be too hard on yourself. We are all here to help you. Let us." Then Hobbs leaves. After some thought, Mason gets up from his desk and walks to training outside.
He walks up to the three trainers and asks how to move a rock. They tell him that he need to stay calm and only think about the rock and the destination. Having complete concentration on the rock, Mason moves it one foot and then celebrates for not giving up and actually doing it. He hears clapping behind him and turns around. All the people who were at the lab the day he got his powers were standing before him. The President walks forward and says to Mason, "Well it looks like you have now mastered all the powers. Do you think you are ready for your first mission? Go talk to General Hobbs in the office if you’re ready." and then walks away to the group of military officials.
Standing on opposite end of the mahogany wooden table, General Hobbs slide the manila envelope with the mission to Mason. While Hobbs briefly goes over the mission, Mason looks through the files. "A group of polar bears living in Kaktovik, Alaska are in trouble. With the climate change, the sea ice where they use for hunting on is melting. Leaving them no places to hunt for food, forcing them to come to land but they are still dying either way. This is where you come in. You need to fly to Kaktovik, Alaska, find the polar bears and use your ice powers to make a lot of ice sheets for the bears to walk on. But first, make sure you get your suit on." General Hobbs explains and then gestures Mason to follow him to the lab.
"So how do you feel in your new suit, Dr. Invincible?" one of the officials say while walking around Mason to make sure his suit looks good. It was an all white suit with red lining on his mask and chest that leaves no skin exposed. Even with his hands covered, he can still shoot ice/water/fire through it just as good if he didn't have his hands covered. Mason was amazed at how well he looks and for once felt happy that he is a superhero. "If you are ready. Then you should go." and with them, he blasted off from the opened roof and flew to save the polar bears.
Once he got the message that he was in Kaktovik,  he flew down onto one of the little ice sheets somewhere far from the polar bears. When he spotted empty waters, he aimed his left hand to that area. Ice shoots out of his hand and creates an ice sheet that is big as a bedroom. Then he hovers above the ground and flies other empty waters and make some more sea ice. After some time he looks around to see his creation, "no more big empty area of water in sight. My work is done." he says in his mind and blasts off back to the island of Kalei.
A few days later in the Goodwin laboratory, Mason focuses on his computer at his desk in the middle of the room, researching how to make his suit make him faster. The screen went from the search's white page to a Facetime with General Hobbs.
"What can I do for you General?" Mason says while scrabbling to straighten his clothes and wipe off any Cheeto crumbs.
"Remember the mission you did in Kaktovik with the polar bears? Well, the ice you created was too hard that the bears can't break the ice to make openings to fish. You need to go back and fix it right away."
"Okay. I am on my way."
"Oh wait, I need you to bring Keith."
"Who? Why would I need to bring him?"
The laboratory doors open and a brunette teenage boy walks into the room. His amazement was clearly shown with his wide eyes and constant turning of his head to look at other fascinating machines in the lab.
"How did you get in my lab?!" Mason angrily exclaims standing up.
"Hey, I was just told I was going to go on a mission to help polar bears," The teenage boy walks closer to Mason with his hands up. "Oh, by the way,I'm Keith." He says and sticks his hand out.
General Hobbs finally starts to explain to Mason that Keith is another superhuman by accident. That he was on a field trip and fell into toxins which gave him the powers to sense danger and super speed.
"It will not only be a good experience for Keith to see a real mission but you guys can bond while doing this together." General Hobbs explains looking at both of them.
"Fine but if he gets in my way then I am leaving him," Mason tells General Hobbs narrowing his eyes at Keith.
"You never know. I might be a great help since I can sense danger." Keith tries to persuade Mason to like him.
"Whatever let's go."
With that, Mason and Keith put their suits on and fly out from the ceiling of the lab to Kaktovik. Once they see big white fluff balls on the group and no sign of the blue water, they land.
"Okay stay close to me. I don't want to have a fight with the bears. If you sense something to tell me." Mason says while searching the area. He then gets to work. When there is an empty ice sheet he hovers fire above it. This melts the ice just a little bit making it easier for the bears to make holes in it. After he was done with one section, Keith starts yelling at him.
"I sense danger coming be on the lookout."
Mason looks around and sees all these polar bears slowly crawling their way towards them. He starts to panic, "What do we do!? I can't fight and hurt all these polar bears!"
"Maybe we can aim fire at them and they will leave," Keith said while inching his way closer to Mason, careful not to go too fast or the bears will think something.
"Let's try it," Mason says and shoots fire in front of the polar bears. His plan did not work, unfortunately, instead, they got angry. The ground shakes while the polar bears rush to them.
All of a sudden, a polar bear appearance in front of the two superhumans but instead of facing them, it was facing the other polar bears. It starts roaring or talking to the bears and then they all retreat and leave. Mason and Keith both lower their hands and quickly put them back up when the polar who saved them faced both of them. It seemed as if magic just happened; the polar bear was now replaced with an adult female.
"Hello, I am Athena. I saw that you were in trouble and thought I should stop by. Oh, I am a shapeshifter," she cheerfully says.
"Thank you for saving our butts but we should get back to work," Mason says and goes back to work. After a few hour, he finished the melting the whole ice area and see that both Athena in bear form and Keith were hanging with the polar bears.
"Would you guys like to come back to my Estate? We can have a chat about maybe working together in the future?" Mason suggests.
"Sure."
"I'm down." Keith and Athena said instantly and all left.
Back at the Goodwin Estate, the three superhumans are sitting around the mahogany table face timing with General Hobbs and talking about more missions to do together. During the meeting, Mason is thinking about all the great things they can all do together as a team.
