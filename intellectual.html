	</center>

<p>With people having the right to freedom of religion and not question each other but still have a common philosophy this made people happy because it shows they will have rights and feel as if they weren't totally controlled. In our civilization, we want everyone to have the freedom to believe whatever they want and in return they have to follow the government because of the social contract. We also adapted from n the Islamic civilization, where they gave the freedom of religion as long as they do not question each other on why they believe that. One of the bigger buildings would be our church. All the different religions would go in there to worship since there is separate rooms. The roof is hollow to make people feel like they are in a empty place and can relax and not feel very claustrophobic. There is also a area for all the religion gods statues. Even though people had free of religion, they all still had to believe in one of kind of philosophy which was Confucianism like in Ancient China. The biggest monuments are the common philosophy towers and rock. We have 2 towers in the entrance to the city and a huge rock by the government stating: love, harmony and respect. Those are the morals all the citizens have to live by. A benefit of having free of religion is that we can expand our civilization because if other groups of people want to come, they will know that they don't have the change their beliefs just so they can live somewhere else but they still have to follow our philosophy. We got this from the Han dynasty because they wanted to expand so they would have people marry people other places so they can adapt to the Chinese culture. We wanted family and respecting others become a big part of our society because it will cause social harmony. Giving people the freedom to chose their religion but still make them follow one philosophy will bring harmony to the civilization.
